# The-Health-App
This is a diet app with a GUI that I coded in VB.net for a college software development project.

Users are able to create accounts that utilise hashed and salted passwords.
Users can reset their passwords with a randomly generated reset code that is unique to the user and expires after 1 minute.
Users can calculate the calories they consume and their BMI via either the metric or imperial measurement system. 
Users can choose to store their weights so that the global lowest, highest and average weights can be calculated.
Users have an individual diary page where they can create, edit and delete diary entries.

You can launch it via “The Health App.exe” or by running “Health App.sln” in Visual Studio.
When launched, the application will create a folder called Data next to the executable. This folder will store all user data in text and csv files.
